# Paint & Chat Application

> This is a combined drawing - chat App with a GUI built with JavaFX and tests in JUnit5. Images are exported in svg-format and can be drawn "by hand" or using pre selected shapes. The user can select already drawn lines or images and modify their size and color, or use the multilevel undo/redo functionality. The user can as a client via a network server connect with TCP Sockets which enables multiple users to simultaneously draw on the same image whilst chatting.
