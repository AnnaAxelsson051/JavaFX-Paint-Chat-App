## By constructing this program I learnt alot about the following

#### MVC Pattern - Model, View, Controller
> A software architectural pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divide the related program logic into three interconnected elements
> - Model: Containing business logic that defines how data can be accessed, created, altered and stored
> - View: Containing FXML code that defines where various elements are dispositioned in the window
> - Controller: Containing View logic that defines how information is displayed and how it can be interacted with 
#### Event handelers
> - Used for notifying the application when the user has withtaken some actions and then redirect these to a specipic target
> - UserKeyEvent, MouseEvent, Action Event, Drag & Drop Events, Key Event, Window Event etc
#### Bindings and properties
> - Used for creating direct relationsbetween variables so that when a change occurs in one object this is automatically detected in another one 
#### JUnit testing
> - Writing tests that checks so that various functionalities within the code renders the correct result when executed 
> - Testing for different conditions with Assert class 
#### File handeling
> - To implement a File Chooser that allows the user to navigate amongst files and save a certain file with a selected name and format at a selected destination 
> - Convert and save objects into csv format 
#### UI
> - Writing **FXML** for an enhanced user experience
> - Working with **Scene Builder** that generates FXML markup live
> - **Canvas API** och 2D och 3D grafik
> - Enbed Css code into JavaFX to enhance styling
> - UI Controls slider
